It appears the `gh` command-line tool is not installed or not in your system's PATH, as the command `gh repo create` failed.

To proceed, please create a new GitHub repository manually by following these steps:

1.  Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
2.  Log in to your account.
3.  Click the `+` sign in the top right corner of the page and select "New repository".
4.  For the "Repository name", enter `rfibot`.
5.  Choose whether you want it to be "Public" or "Private". For this task, "Public" is generally simpler, but choose according to your preference.
6.  **Important:** Do NOT check "Add a README file", "Add .gitignore", or "Choose a license". We already have these files locally, and checking these options will create conflicts.
7.  Click the "Create repository" button.

Once the repository is created, please provide me with the HTTPS URL for the empty repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/rfibot.git`).

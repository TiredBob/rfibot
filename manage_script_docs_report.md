I have updated the `README.md` file to include a dedicated section for the `manage.sh` script, detailing its commands and usage. Additionally, `USAGE.md` has been updated with a reference to the `README.md` for bot management instructions.

These changes have been committed locally.

I am awaiting your instruction to push these changes to the remote `main` branch.

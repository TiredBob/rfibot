The local changes, including all the `SyntaxError` fixes in `cogs/games.py` and the `AttributeError` fix in `cogs/utils.py`, have been successfully pushed to the remote `main` branch.

All the identified issues that were preventing the cogs from loading and commands from being processed should now be resolved on the remote repository.

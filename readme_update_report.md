I have updated the `README.md` file and created a new `USAGE.md` file as requested.

*   `README.md` now provides a comprehensive overview of the bot, its features, setup instructions, logging details, and troubleshooting tips.
*   `USAGE.md` provides a brief guide on how to use the bot after it's been added to a server, covering permissions, command usage, the bot-status channel, and inviting the bot to other servers.

These changes have been committed locally.

I am awaiting your instruction to push these changes to the remote `main` branch.

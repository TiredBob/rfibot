No, the Gemini functionality has **not** been removed from the bot.

While the logs previously showed errors related to the Gemini API (e.g., "API key not valid", "Resource exhausted", "model not found"), indicating that the integration might have been experiencing issues, the code for the Gemini functionality is still present in the bot.

I have not taken any actions to remove it. In fact, in the recently updated `README.md`, it is still listed as a core feature under "AI Integration."

If you intended for it to be removed, please let me know, and I can proceed with that.

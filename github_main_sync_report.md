The local repository's `main` branch has been successfully pushed and synchronized with the remote GitHub repository's `main` branch.

All your changes are now available on the `main` branch on GitHub.

Would you like me to delete the `master` branch (both locally and remotely) since its content has been migrated to `main`?

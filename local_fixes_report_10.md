I have updated the help command as requested:

*   The `send_bot_help` method in `cogs/help.py` has been modified. It will now check if a command has aliases and, if so, display them alongside the command's signature in the main `!help` output.

This change has been committed locally.

I am awaiting your instruction to push these changes to the remote `main` branch.
